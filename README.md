This is a Mandelbrot program in Amiga E or EVO for AmigaOS 3.1.
It renders in 640Ã—512 AGA hi-res lace with 256 colours and supports interactive zooming
and saving the image as an uncompressed 8-bit ILBM (IFF) file.

## Build

Compile with the Amiga E compiler:

```
ec mandelbrot.e -o Mandelbrot
```

Run the resulting executable on an AGA-capable AmigaOS 3.1 machine. Drag with the left
mouse button to select an area and zoom. Press `s` to save the current view to
`mandel.iff` or press `Esc` or any other mouse button to exit.

### Build with Docker

To compile using the [ECX](https://github.com/jj1bdx/ecx) cross-compiler inside Docker:

```
docker build -t mandelbrot-e .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" mandelbrot-e
```

The resulting `Mandelbrot` binary will be written to the repository directory and can be
copied to an AmigaOS 3.1 system.
